Green style for Soylent News

Changes to the site CSS:

* Turn Soylent News from red to green.
* Use CSS rounded borders instead of rounded GIFs.
* Change background colors.
* Change font size and spacing (the font line in body {} is important)

Include this file in Stylish with these two lines in the Stylish editor:

    @import "file:///path/to/stylish/soylent-green.css";
    @-moz-document url-prefix(http), url-prefix(file) {}

Keep the Stylish window open and click Preview to make it apply your changes.
